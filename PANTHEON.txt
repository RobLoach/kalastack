Working with Pantheon
======================
SITE ALIASES

The first step to working with Pantheon is to get your site aliases. These are 
available for download on your Pantheon account page. You will need to put the 
downloaded file into ~/.drush/ on your Kalabox.. You can verify that they are 
functioning correctly by running "drush sa" on your Kalabox.

SSH KEYS

You are also going to want to make sure you add your Kalabox ssh public key to 
pantheon. Kalabox automatically generates these keys for you on installation.
You can find the public key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. You may be able to open it by 
going to the HOME network share on your host or you can run the following command 
on your Kalabox:

	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Just copy and paste the output into Pantheon. If you are prompted for a password 
try rebooting your Kalabox. If this still doesn't work try running the following 
command

	ssh -v -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa git@code.getpantheon.com


DRUSH

Kalabox ships with 8 custom drush commands designed specifically for Pantheon 
and Kalabox. They are useless without Pantheon's site alias file.
 
These commands only work with your dev environments. You will use the same 
naming convention as your pantheon aliases 	(PANTHEON.SITENAME.ENV) but you will 
omit the @. You are using the alias name as an argument, not as an alias.
Here are the commands.

	1. drush build pantheon.SITENAME.dev   

		Will completely build your pantheon site on your Kalabox, this will 
		edit settings.php and set up a vhost. After running this command and
		adding your server name to your hosts /etc/hosts file you should be
		able to browse to the site.

	2. drush krefresh pantheon.SITENAME.dev 

		Will refresh the code, database and files on your Kalabox from your 
		pantheon site

	3. drush crush pantheon.SITENAME.dev

		Will completely remove pantheon.SITENAME.dev from your Kalabox.
		
	4. drush kala
    
        Will show helpful info
        
	5. drush code pantheon.SITENAME.dev    

		Will either git clone or git pull from your pantheon codebase to your 
		Kalabox at /var/www/SITENAME
    
	6. drush data pantheon.SITENAME.dev    

		Will either download and import from your pantheon database to your 
		Kalabox at kala:SITENAME_kala
		
	7. drush files pantheon.SITENAME.dev   

		Will sync your pantheon files to your Kalabox at 
		/var/www/SITENAME/sites/default/files
		
	8. drush vhost pantheon.SITENAME.dev   

		Will build and enable a nginx vhost file of your pantheon site on your 
		Kalabox at SITENAME.kala

UPDATING YOUR HOST HOSTS FILE

Remember that the Kalabox does not automatically update the /etc/hosts file on 
your HOST so you will have to add the following line manually.

	"192.168.56.101    SITENAME.kala"

You should now be able to navigate to SITENAME.kala in your browser and get to 
your site!
