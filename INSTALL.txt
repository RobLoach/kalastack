Installation
======================

PRE-INSTALLATION CHECKS

You can install Kalabox manually as this allows for additional configuration and
customization or you can download our premade box and get up 
and running right away! However before you do either there are a couple of 
steps you need to do first.

1. Install Virtual Box (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Add the following entry to the /etc/hosts* file on your computer.
	
	192.168.56.101 kala KALABOXHOSTNAME php.kala 

	If you are using a pre made box KALABOXHOSTNAME = kalabox, if you are 
	installing manually you should replace KALABOXHOSTNAME with whatever you plan 
	on entering as a hostname during the installation of Ubuntu 12.04 Server. 
	Do notuse the hostname kalabox as this is reserved for our premade box.
	
	* On Windows XP this is located at c:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

3. Make sure you have a VBOXNET network adapter in your Virtual Box. 

You can configure these in the VirtualBox Preferences; 
there should be one already created for you called vboxnet0. 
If there isn't simply click the add icon and click OK. Make sure that the 
adapter is set to 192.168.56.1. 

IMPORTING YOUR VB APPLIANCE

Manual Install
==============
If you wish to install manually you can start by downloading our blank Kalabox at 
http://files.kalamuna.com/blankbox.tar.gz

You will also need to download the 64 bit version of Ubuntu 12.04 Server at 
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server. 

Premade Install
===============
If you wish to install our pre made Kalabox you can download that at.
http://files.kalamuna.com/kalabox1rc3.tar.gz

Import your Box
================
In Virtual Box go to File -> Import Appliance and select the Kalabox that you 
downloaded. If you installed a pre made Kalabox all you need to do is start 
the box, login with user:kala, password:box and you will be good to go!

Please also check the "Post Installation Setup + Tips & Tricks" and
"Working with Pantheon" sections below.

If you were more adventurous and installed the blank box please continue reading!

SETTING UP YOUR SERVER

1. Install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server*

	* Start your blank box and select the Ubuntu image you downloaded.
	* Run through the installation normally but make sure you select eth0 as 
	  your primary network adapter and do not select any of the packages such as 
	  SSH or LAMP when it asks you at the end.
	* After installation load up your box and login!
	* Some machines may throw a kernal error. If this happens you should check your
	  machine's settings -> System -> Processor and check "Enable PAE/NX".

2. Run the following commands once you have logged in:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install puppet
	sudo puppet agent --verbose --test --pluginsync --server kalabox.kalamuna.com

That should be it! Your Kalabox should be ready to go! 
Please see below for some useful tips!

Post Installation Setup + Tips & Tricks
======================
USING SSH

Once you have completed the setup we recommend that you minimize VB and the 
VB Terminal in favor of using your HOST's terminal. This allows for a more 
authenticate experience as it relates to development. Open a terminal in your 
host and type 

	ssh USERNAME@kala

This will connect you to your Kalabox. Your will use the username you set up 
during installation of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server. If 	you installed a pre made box 
then your user will be "kala" and your password will be "box." 

ACCESSING YOUR WEBROOT/DRUSH/HOME

You may want to edit your code using an IDE on your HOST, download your Pantheon 
aliases or add custom drush commands. Check the network on your HOST and you 
should see three shares for your vbox: 
    
	1. WWW <- Your Webroot
    2. DRUSH <- Your drush library
    3. HOME <- Your home folder
    
If you don't see them you can try connecting to smb://kala. In MaxOSX you can 
do this by going to Finder -> Go -> Connect to Server. In Ubuntu 12.04 the
shares are mounted in ~/.gvfs.
    

Working with Pantheon
======================
SITE ALIASES

The first step to working with Pantheon is to get your site aliases. These are 
available for download on your Pantheon account page. You will want to open up 
your HOME network share and put them in the .drush folder. You can verify that 
they are in there by running "drush sa" on your Kalabox.

SSH KEYS

You are also going to want to make sure you add your Kalabox ssh public key to 
pantheon. Kalabox automatically generates these keys for you on installation.
You can find the public key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. You may be able to open it by 
going to the HOME network share on your host or you can run the following command 
on your Kalabox:

	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Just copy and paste the output into Pantheon. If you are prompted for a password 
try rebooting your Kalabox. If this still doesn't work try running the following 
command

	ssh -v -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa git@code.getpantheon.com


DRUSH

Kalabox ships with 8 custom drush commands designed specifically for Pantheon 
and Kalabox. They are useless without Pantheon's site alias file.
 
These commands only work with your dev environments. You will use the same 
naming convention as your pantheon aliases 	(PANTHEON.SITENAME.ENV) but you will 
omit the @. You are using the alias name as an argument, not as an alias.
Here are the commands.

    1. drush kala
    
        Will show helpful info
        
	2. drush code pantheon.SITENAME.dev    

		Will either git clone or git pull from your pantheon codebase to your 
		Kalabox at /var/www/SITENAME
    
	3. drush data pantheon.SITENAME.dev    

		Will either download and import from your pantheon database to your 
		Kalabox at kala:SITENAME_kala
		
	4. drush files pantheon.SITENAME.dev   

		Will sync your pantheon files to your Kalabox at 
		/var/www/SITENAME/sites/default/files
		
	5. drush vhost pantheon.SITENAME.dev   

		Will build and enable a nginx vhost file of your pantheon site on your 
		Kalabox at SITENAME.kala

	6. drush build pantheon.SITENAME.dev   

		Will completely build your pantheon site on your Kalabox, this will 
		edit settings.php and set up a vhost. After running this command and
		adding your server name to your hosts /etc/hosts file you should be
		able to browse to the site.

	7. drush krefresh pantheon.SITENAME.dev 

		Will refresh the code, database and files on your Kalabox from your 
		pantheon site

	8. drush crush pantheon.SITENAME.dev

		Will completely remove pantheon.SITENAME.dev from your Kalabox.

UPDATING YOUR HOST HOSTS FILE

Remember that the Kalabox does not automatically update the /etc/hosts file on 
your HOST so you will have to add the following line manually.


	"192.168.56.101    SITENAME.kala"

You should now be able to navigate to SITENAME.kala in your browser and get to 
your site!
