Installation
======================

PRE-INSTALLATION CHECKS

Kalabox currently shops as a premade Virtual Box image. This way you can get up 
and running right away! However before you do this there are a couple of 
steps you need to do first.

1. Install Virtual Box (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Add the following entry to the /etc/hosts* file on your computer.
	
	192.168.56.101 kala kalabox php.kala grind.kala
	* On Windows XP this is located at c:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

3. Make sure you have a VBOXNET network adapter in your Virtual Box. 

You can configure these in the VirtualBox Preferences; 
there should be one already created for you called vboxnet0. 
If there isn't simply click the add icon and click OK. Make sure that the 
adapter is set to 192.168.56.1. 

IMPORTING YOUR VB APPLIANCE

Download
===============
If you wish to install our pre made Kalabox you can download it at:
http://files.kalamuna.com/kalabox1rc5.tar.gz

Import your Box
================
In Virtual Box go to File -> Import Appliance and select the Kalabox that you 
downloaded. If you installed a pre made Kalabox all you need to do is start 
the box, login with user:kala, password:box and you will be good to go!

Please also check the "Post Installation Setup + Tips & Tricks" below and
the other documentation that comes with the download.

Post Installation Setup + Tips & Tricks
======================

USING SSH

Once you have completed the setup we recommend that you minimize VB and the 
VB Terminal in favor of using your HOST's terminal. This allows for a more 
authenticate experience as it relates to development. Open a terminal in your 
host and type 

	ssh kala@kala

This will connect you to your Kalabox. Your user will be "kala" and your password
will be "box." 

ACCESSING YOUR WEBROOT/DRUSH/HOME

You may want to edit your code using an IDE on your HOST. Check the network on your HOST 
and you should see a share for your vbox: 
    
	1. WWW <- Your Webroot
    
If you don't see them you can try connecting to smb://kala. In MaxOSX you can 
do this by going to Finder -> Go -> Connect to Server. In Ubuntu 12.04 the
shares are mounted in ~/.gvfs.

GITCONFIG

You should also override the default gitconfig directives with your name and email.
From kalabox run:

git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config --global user.email user@example.com
