Working with Xdebug
======================

Kalabox ships with xdebug for both debugging and profiling. 

DEBUGGING

For debugging we recommend you use an IDE on your host OS such as netbeans or
eclipse. The xdebug setup should already be done on the Kalabox end so you should 
only need to set up your IDE. 

Here is some useful documentation to help:

PROFILING

For profiling we recommend you use the webgrind client which comes preconfigured
with your Kalabox and is located at grind.kala.

Profiling on every page has a performance impact so you must trigger what pages
you want to profile. You can do this manually by appending ?XDEBUG_PROFILE to 
the URL (see http://xdebug.org/docs/profiler for more detail) and then 
checking webgrind. 

Many broswers also offer tools/plugins to turn profiling on and off.
