KALABOX 
=====================
Kalabox is a local server environment optimized for PHP development. It was built with Drupal in mind but, with 
small tweaks, can be used for any PHP development. It currently ships with the following packages, all configured and 
tuned, optimized for a fast, best-practices local development experience.

1.  nginx
2.  PHP5 (with common extensions including apc and xdebug)
3.  MySQL
4.  Apache Solr
5.  Apache Tomcat
6.  SSH
7.  git
8.  drush (with custom commands for Pantheon integration)
9.  PHPMyAdmin
10. samba (to expose your webroot to your VB host)

Kalabox was intended to be run on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and has not been tested (and likely does not work) on other operating systems.  
You can run Kalabox natively in Ubuntuy 12.04 LTS or, with some additional setup, you can run it on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server inside
of a Virtual Box. Kalamuna recommends running Kalabox in Virtual Box.

Kalabox does not ship with an IDE so people have the flexibility to choose their own. 

Kalabox was also built to work seamlessly with Pantheon Systems.


Supported 
=====================
Drupal 6
Drupal 7

Installation
======================
You can install Kalabox manually as this allows for additional configuration and customization or you can download either our 32 or 64 bit VB images and get up and running right away! However before you do either there are a couple of steps you need to do first.

1. Install Virtual Box (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Add the following entry to the /etc/hosts file on your computer.
	
	192.168.56.101 kala KALABOXHOSTNAME php.kala 

	If you are using a pre made box KALABOXHOSTNAME = kalabox, if you are installing manually you should replace KALABOXHOSTNAME
	with whatever you plan on entering as a hostname during the installation of Ubuntu 12.04 Server

3. Make sure you have a VBOXNET network adapter in your Virtual Box. 

You can configure these in the VirtualBox Preferences; there should be one already created for you called vboxnet0. If there isn't simply click the add icon and click OK.

IMPORTING YOUR VB APPLIANCE

If you wish to install manually you can start by downloading our blank Kalabox at http://kalabox.kalamuna.com/kalabox.ova. You will also need to download the 64 bit version of Ubuntu 12.04 Server at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server. 

If you wish to install our pre made Kalabox you can download that at LINK.

In Virtual Box go to File -> Import Appliance and select the Kalabox that you downloaded. If you installed a pre made Kalabox all you will need to do is start the box after import is complete and that is it! If you were more adventurous and installed the blank box please continue reading!

SET UP YOUR SERVER

1. Install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server*

	* Start your blank box and select the Ubuntu image you downloaded.
	* Run through the installation normally but make sure you select eth0 as your primary network adapter and do not select
	  any of the packages such as SSH or LAMP when it asks you at the end.
	* After installation load up your box and login!

2. Run the following commands once you have logged in:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install puppet
	sudo puppet agent --verbose --test --pluginsync --server kalabox.kalamuna.com
       sudo reboot

That should be it! Your Kalabox should be ready to go! Please see below for some useful tips!

Post Installation Setup + Tips & Tricks
======================
USING SSH

    	Once you have completed the setup we recommend that you minimize VB and the VB Terminal in favor of using your HOST's terminal. 	This allows for a more authenticate experience as it relates to development. Open a terminal in your host and type 

	ssh USERNAME@kala

    	This will connect you to your Kalabox. Your will use the username you set up during installation of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server. If 	you installed a pre made box then your user will be "kala" and your password will be "box." 

ACCESSING YOUR WEBROOT/DRUSH/HOME

    	You may want to edit your code using an IDE on your HOST, download your Pantheon aliases or add custom drush commands. Check 	the network on your HOST and you should see three shares for your vbox: 
    
    	1. WWW <- Your Webroot
    	2. DRUSH <- Your drush library
    	3. HOME <- Your home folder
    

Working with Pantheon
======================
SITE ALIASES

	The first step to working with pantheon is to get your site aliases. These are available for download on your pantheon account 	page. You will want to open up your HOME network share and put them in the .drush folder. You can verify that they are in there 	by running "drush sa" on your Kalabox.

SSH KEYS

	You are also going to want to make sure you add your Kalabox ssh public key to pantheon. Kalabox automatically generates these 	keys for you on installation. You can find the public key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. You may be able to open it by going to the HOME 	network share on your host or you can run the following command on your Kalabox:

	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

	Just copy and paste the output into Pantheon. If you are prompted for a password try rebooting your Kalabox.


DRUSH

	Kalabox ships with 6 custom drush commands designed specifically for Pantheon and Kalabox. They are useless without pantheon's 	site alias file.
 
	These commands only work with your dev environments. You will use the same naming convention as your pantheon aliases 		(PANTHEON.SITENAME.ENV) but you will omit the @. Here are the commands.

	drush code pantheon.SITENAME.dev    

		Will either git clone or git pull from your pantheon codebase to your Kalabox at /var/www/SITENAME
    
	drush data pantheon.SITENAME.dev    

		Will either download and import from your pantheon database to your Kalabox at kala:SITENAME_kala
	drush files pantheon.SITENAME.dev   

		Will sync your pantheon files to your Kalabox at /var/www/SITENAME/sites/default/files
	drush vhost pantheon.SITENAME.dev   

		Will build and enable a nginx vhost file of your pantheon site on your Kalabox at SITENAME.kala

	drush build pantheon.SITENAME.dev   

		Will completely build your pantheon site on your Kalabox, this will edit settings.php

	drush krefresh pantheon.SITENAME.dev 

		Will refresh the code, database and files on your Kalabox from your pantheon site

	drush wmd pantheon.SITENAME.dev

		Will completely remove pantheon.SITENAME.dev from your Kalabox.

	*Remember that the Kalabox does not automatically update the /etc/hosts file on your HOST so you will have to check for and 	edit the following line when you build a new site

	"192.168.56.1      kala php.kala"

	and add your new site to it

	"192.168.56.1    kala php.kala SITENAME.kala"

	You should now be able to navigate to SITENAME.kala in your browser and get to your site!
